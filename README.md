This repository contains code using R's *dyplr*, *ggplot2* and *ShinyApps* for handling and visiualizing data, and using *devtools* for package development. 

Workout01: This project involves analyzing and visualizing the shot statistics of 5 NBA players from the Golden State Warriors. The project includes outputting summary shot statistics of individual players in .txt format as well as their shot charts in .pdf formats. In addition to the requirement, there is also a preliminary analysis of players' shot statistics against their fatigue level. The main deliverable of this project is the report workout01-ran-meng.md in report sub-directory. However, raw data, scripts and images & summaries outputs can be found in different subdirectories as well.

Workout02: This project involves creating saving simulations with different investing modalities, and visualizing the return simulations with the interactive ShinyApp UI package that comes with R.

Binomial: This project involves developing a R package named binomial, which contains functions for calculating probabilities, displaying the results in dataframes and plotting the results related to the Binomial Distribution.
